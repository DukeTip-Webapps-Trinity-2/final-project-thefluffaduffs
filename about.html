          foods and snacks for affordable prices! We have an amazing attraction, <em> Boombastic Bonanza, </em> that is one of our most popular!
          We are considering opening a second park in another city just like this awesome one, but probably won't due to cost reasons.

   <p class="font" style="text-indent:50px">EverVenturez was started in 2018 when some kids in a class were given a final project which tasked them with designing a website for a national park, a petting zoo, or an amusement park.
     Ultimately, they chose the amusment park. They were told that it didn't have to be realistic, so they took that idea and ran with it...for better or for worse, and EverVenturez was born! One of them 
     came up with 51 ideas for attractions, many of which were basically bootleg copyrighted things, or were kinda dumb. One of them tried to be the voice of reason, saying that there should just be a top 
     20 of good attraction names, but he was outvoted. However, he was allowed to change 5 names to actually good attraction names. Much time was wasted getting picutres and descriptions for each attraction 
     before actually making the site look professional in any way. The previously mentioned voice of reason had plenty of headaches from other group members doing stupid things, whether it was in terms of 
    site design, writing, logic, lack of a serious attitude towards the project, and being generally annoying. The journey was sort of a train wreck, but hopefully the final result is good.</p>
