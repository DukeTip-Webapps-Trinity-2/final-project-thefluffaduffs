-Made the code FOR the price calculator    
-Reminded everyone that just because it could've been finished in the middle of Day 1, that it didn't mean that it had to be finished then and that it should've looked  p r o f e s s i o n a l .
-Helped fix code
-Did the proper grammars when someone else messed up
