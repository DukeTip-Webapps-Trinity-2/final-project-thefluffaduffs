  <h1 class= "text-center" > About Us </h1>
  <p class="font" style="text-indent:50px">At EverVenturez, we have the best selection of rides you'll ever see! We have everything from a Mystical Corner to an amazing
    dining hall with great food! We have roller-coasters, bumper cars and a lot more including  Unicorn Bumper Cars! This will be
    the greatest experience of your life! Come on Friday and you will see beautiful fireworks! We have over 50 mystical attractions,
    and plenty of options for fine dining! We have a small section for kids under 8 years. You can click
    <a href="img/babababy.jpg">
      here</a> to see a part of our amazing little kids corner! If you get hungry, we have lots of snack posts, food trucks, and <em>even a dining hall,</em> all serving lots of delicious 
          foods and snacks for affordable prices! We have an amazing attraction, <em> Boombastic Bonanza, </em> that is one of our most popular!
          We are considering opening a second park in another city just like this awesome one, but probably won't due to cost reasons.</p>
       
          <p class="font" style="text-indent:50px">
      EverVenturez is tied with life itself for the best thing in existence. Our prices are relatively cheap for all of our awesome rides.
       Well, I think the job was pretty well done considering pretty much half of the time they were given was used on making  the 51 ride names, descriptions and pictures including 
       our World Famous Gucci Teacups and Despacito Dyve. Not to mention, this park is so popular that Biggie Cheese himself comes here! One of our rides is dedicated to him and he is there 
       almost every day! You can come to our park to come see the famous Biggie Cheese! If you are not one of those people and you just want a fun place to go, we have normal rides. Ultimately, 
       this park is awesome!! Bring everyone! People of all ages will have a place to go in this park! Even them babies and tiny kiddies!!

    <h2 class="text-center">The Origins of EverVentures</h2>
   <p class="font" style="text-indent:50px">EverVenturez was started in 2018 when some kids in a class were given a final project which tasked them with designing a website for a national park, a petting zoo, or an amusement park.
     Ultimately, they chose the amusment park. They were told that it didn't have to be realistic, so they took that idea and ran with it...for better or for worse, and EverVenturez was born! One of them 
     came up with 51 ideas for attractions, many of which were basically bootleg copyrighted things, or were kinda dumb. One of them tried to be the voice of reason, saying that there should just be a top 
     20 of good attraction names, but he was outvoted. However, he was allowed to change 5 names to actually good attraction names. Much time was wasted getting picture and descriptions for each attraction 
     before actually making the site look professional in any way. The previously mentioned voice of reason had plenty of headaches from other group members doing stupid things, whether it was in terms of 
    site design, writing, or logic. The journey was sort of a train wreck, but hopefully the final result is good. <span style="font-size: 5px; margin: 5px; color:rgb(55, 55, 55)">help</span></p>
